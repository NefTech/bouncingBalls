# **Bouncing Balls: An object oriented programming activity (OOP)
The bouncing balls project is a project that is provided by Mozilla Developer Network as a practice tool. It lets you practice wiritng an object but also helps you go over what each part of the code does. This provides the opportunity for you to visualize the code.

[This is a link to MDN, which is where we got the Object practice problem from.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_building_practice "Mozilla Developer Network's Object practice page")

## What I learned and My Examples
This activity was done as a guided group activity. We went over every step in the process and therefore I learned to look at the code, break it down to undertsand what it does and visualize the code. Below is my version of my practice objects examples provided.
